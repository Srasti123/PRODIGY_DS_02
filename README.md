🚢 Task 2 – Titanic Dataset Analysis (EDA)
📌 Project Overview

This project is part of my internship with Prodigy InfoTech. The goal was to perform Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic Dataset to identify patterns and relationships that influenced passenger survival.

The Titanic dataset is widely used for practicing data analysis and machine learning, as it contains real-world information about passengers such as age, gender, class, and survival status.

🚀 Steps Involved

1. Dataset Loading
* Loaded Titanic dataset from Seaborn/Kaggle.

2. Data Cleaning
* Filled missing age with median.
* Filled missing embarked with most common value.
* Dropped deck column due to many missing values.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Age Distribution – Analyzed age spread among passengers.
* Survival by Gender – Compared survival rates of males vs females.
* Survival by Class – Studied the effect of passenger class on survival chances.
* Correlation Heatmap – Checked numeric relationships between variables.
* Survival by Embarkation Point – Explored how boarding point affected survival.

📊 Key Insights

a. Women had much higher survival rates compared to men.

b. 1st class passengers survived the most, while 3rd class suffered the highest losses.

c. Younger passengers had better chances of survival.

d. Embarkation point (C, Q, S) also influenced survival probabilities.

🛠️ Technologies Used

1. Python

2. Pandas – Data Cleaning & Analysis

3. Seaborn & Matplotlib – Visualizations
